            <h2>Research Overview</h2>
            <p>My group is committed to integrating interdisciplinary knowledge from physics, computer science, and mathematics to advance research in multi-omics big data within the life sciences. Our mission is to unravel the complexities of biological systems, including brain science, tumor immunology, and the dynamic evolution of organ function across species.</p>

                <h3>1. Multi-Omics Big Data / Computational Biology</h3>
                <p>Combining genomics, single-cell analysis, spatial transcriptomics, and epigenetics, we utilize multi-omics big data to elucidate mechanisms at the molecular and cellular levels during biological processes.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>2. Evolutionary Developmental at Cellular and Functional Levels</h3>
                <p>Focusing on understanding the spatiotemporal dimensions of the central dogma (from the central dogma to spatiotemporal principles), we develop novel computational methods for studying evolutionary development at molecular, cellular, and structural levels. This includes exploring the mechanisms of tissue and organ development and investigating the principles of structure and function evolution.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>3. Brain Science and Cancer Research</h3>
                <p>We construct cell atlases of brain tissues and tumor microenvironments, study the diversity of cell types and spatial structures in the nervous and immune systems, and explore the regulatory mechanisms of cell migration and differentiation.</p>
            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>4. Comparative Genomics</h3>
                <p>Through genomic and population genetic analyses, we investigate the genetic mechanisms underlying species adaptability and changes in population structure.</p>
